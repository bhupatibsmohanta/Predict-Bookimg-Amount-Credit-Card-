***************

reading of clean data using pandas library and user personal information which are 
not important to data analysis are dropped. e.g. name, address, gender etc.

Approval rate and Booking rate are calculted.

Filter out those applicants whose application were declined as they are non-potential customer.
P.S. Do not delete these applicants data as they may be useful for future reference by the bank.)

Similarly filter out the pending applicants as they have the potential to be a customer in near future.

We have to analyze the approved applications to predict the Booking amount for the pending applications.
i) For approved applications columns like 'Booking' and 'tdecision' are irrelevant, so drop them.
ii) Label Encode all the categorical data in the approved applications.
iii) Apply feature scaling to continuos data in the approved applications.

Apply ML algorithms on approved applications data with 'Booking_Amt' as target column.
Since the raw data is clean so we may get very high accuracy on the ML model. (overfitting)

As we are going to predict 'Booking_Amt' for pending applications, 
the predicted result will give a rough estimation on 'Booking_Amt'.

Inorder to predict 'Booking_Amt' for pending applications, the pending applications will also require
the same preprocessing as approved applications (as mentioned in (i), (ii),(iii)).


Similarly, we can predict the 'Booking_Amt' for any new customer after approval of their applications.
As there were no new customer for whom we need to predict the 'Booking_Amt', so that part is not done.
